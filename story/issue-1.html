                The name felt right. The song was about breaking free from systems that held you down, about moving so fast that no one could catch you, about finding your own path when all the roads were blocked. It was personal. It was <em>her</em>.

                When she finally hit "Upload" on the music platform, her heart hammered with hope. Maybe this was it. Maybe someone would finally hear what she'd been trying to say. The platform's loading bar filled slowly, agonizingly. Then—
